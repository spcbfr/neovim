Hey, this is my current neovim config, it's forked from [kickstart.nvim](github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), kickstart is _not_ a neovim distro, rather it's a basic single-file config that I extended to suit my workflow. feel free to fork it as-is, copy chunks you find useful or check out kickstart itself.
